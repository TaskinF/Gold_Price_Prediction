# Gold Price Prediction

This project is my first machine learning project.
The main purpose of this project is to predict the gold price using SPX, USO (United States Oil), SLV (Silver), EUR/USD values. Since it is the first project I have done, a very simple model has been created. The data is also taken from Kaggle.
